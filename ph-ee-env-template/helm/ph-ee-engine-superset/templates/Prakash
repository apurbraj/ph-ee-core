Went silent for a long time on asking if he has a question after describing first example.

Read the question out loud and clear.

Got confused easily with the test case input of 2 matrices. Average interpretation.

After explaining the test cases, 30 minutes of mostly silence (thinking quietly even after encouraging to think out loud, waiting for interviewer to tell the next step instead of being proactive).

@Ankita:
Encourage candidates more to think of intermediate steps instead of directly thinking of the final solution.

Let the candidate set the participant horse nos and line them up on the 5 tracks so that they feel more ownership towards the final solution.

Encourage elimination process and dry run.
